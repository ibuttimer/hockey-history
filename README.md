# Hockey History

Hockey History provides a brief history of the game of field hockey, outlining key events in the development of the game.
It also provides additional details related to the game in Ireland. 
The resources page provides links to Irish and international organisations and resources, which support the development of the game.

The site is aimed at both sports enthusiasts and history scholars. The aim is to provide a history of the game, as well as acting as a useful resource.

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement

- Another feature idea

## Design 
The design specification is available in [design.md](design/design.md).

## Testing 

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your project’s features and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.


### Accessibility
Accessibility testing was carried out using the [NVDA](https://www.nvaccess.org/) and [ChromeVox](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/screen-reader/kgejglhpjiefppelpmljglcjbhoiplfn?hl=en) screen readers.

### Unfixed Bugs

You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed. 

## Deployment

The site was deployed as a static website, hosted directly from the GitHub repository via [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

The following steps were followed to deploy the website: 
  - Navigate to the `Settings` tab in the GitHub repository
  - Under the `Code and automation` section, select `Pages`
  - Under `Source`, select `main` from the Branch dropdown menu
  - Once the website is published, the page will refresh indicting the successful deployment, and providing link to the live website. 

The live website is available at [https://ibuttimer.github.io/hockey-history/](https://ibuttimer.github.io/hockey-history/)

## Other General Project Advice

Below you will find a couple of extra tips that may be helpful when completing your project. Remember that each of these projects will become part of your final portfolio so it’s important to allow enough time to showcase your best work! 

- One of the most basic elements of keeping a healthy commit history is with the commit message. When getting started with your project, read through [this article](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) by Chris Beams on How to Write  a Git Commit Message 
  - Make sure to keep the messages in the imperative mood 

- When naming the files in your project directory, make sure to consider meaningful naming of files, point to specific names and sections of content.
  - For example, instead of naming an image used ‘image1.png’ consider naming it ‘landing_page_img.png’. This will ensure that there are clear file paths kept. 

- Do some extra research on good and bad coding practices, there are a handful of useful articles to read, consider reviewing the following list when getting started:
  - [Writing Your Best Code](https://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/writing-your-best-code/)
  - [HTML & CSS Coding Best Practices](https://medium.com/@inceptiondj.info/html-css-coding-best-practice-fadb9870a00f)
  - [Google HTML/CSS Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/htmlcssguide.html#General)

Getting started with your Portfolio Projects can be daunting, planning your project can make it a lot easier to tackle, take small steps to reach the final outcome and enjoy the process!
