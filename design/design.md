# Strategy
The strategy is to create a website outlining the history of field hockey. It will provide a brief overview of the development of the game and act as a resource for hockey related information.

# Scope
The website will not host all available content but will provide basic information and links to external resources where appropriate.

# Structure
Due to the low number of pages and the fact the pages will not be inter-dependent, the website will utilise a non-linear hyperlinked navigation structure. 

# Skeleton
The website will consist of four pages:
- Home
  
  Main page with the history of field hockey, a timeline of key events and other facts.
- Ireland

  Ireland-specific page of hockey events and facts.
- Resources

  Page with links to Irish and international organisations, hockey blogs etc.
- Built With

  Page detailing the technologies and resources used to build the website.

# General layout
Each of the pages will have the same general layout:
- Navigation buttons at top of page, with current page highlighted in a different colour. The buttons will contain the appropriate text, and FontAwsome icons will be used to visually represent the function of each page.
- A banner image, overlayed with title and subtitle if necessary

# Wireframes
Wireframes of page layouts are available at the following location:
